We rate Elbonia's main company Turnips Inc. a solid buy.
The Elbonian economy has been on the rise since Wanald Grumpf came to power.
This upswing in economy will result in increased investment in Turnips Inc. 
The end of potato farming will release more land for use by Turnips Inc.
More production is expected due to synergies with Ham & Bacon Inc, a sister company.
